My Resume/CV in LaTex.

Based on the [moderncv](https://github.com/xdanaux/moderncv) latex template by Xavier Danaux (distributed under [LPPL v1.3c](https://www.latex-project.org/lppl/lppl-1-3c.txt))

## Notes
Feel free to modify the .tex to make your own resume. Don't use my resume or its contents for anything else without my permission.
